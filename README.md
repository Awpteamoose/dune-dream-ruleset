# General ruleset description:
* [WBC](http://www.boardgamers.org/wbc19/previews/dun.html) as base (which in turn is based on [AH](http://www.sorvan.com/games/dune/Rules/DuneRules.pdf))
* GF9-style thopter stealing
* Fremen changes:
	* GF9-style can ship, move or worm-ride into/out/through storm (to give back a little bit of lost value due to thopter stealing)
	* Alliance ability: worm protection (if Fremen allow it) + all spice spent by ally on fighting is reclaimed by the ally during collection phase (effectively a self-bribe)
* Karama changes:
	* GF9 harkonnen karama (once per game, take whole hand), but must be played at the start of Battle Phase (as in WBC)
	* Emperor karama can revive sardaukar without respecting 1/turn limit altogether i.e. revive 3 sardaukar if desired (this is a WBC ruling but it isn't written down and it goes against the RAW)
	* You can deny Emperor alliance power (spice sharing) for one whole phase (i.e. you can prevent Emp from powering up their ally during battle), this doesn't prevent normal ally spice sharing tho e.g. paying for shipping or bids
	* You can deny WBC Emperor non-ally subsidy power for the whole bidding phase
	* Atreides karama special is as it is in GF9 i.e. the battle plan is revealed only to Atreides rather than to everyone (unlike prescience answer), no 1/game limit
	* If one were to karama Emperor receiving money for a bid, the money goes to the bank (same as in GF9, in WBC no payment is made)
* If due to Shield Wall stronghold two solo players control 3 strongholds, whoever controls the real strongholds wins
* GF9-style traitor wins (victor loses nothing, including not being able to discard CH or WLC)
* Bene Gesserit place a bonus troop anywhere during setup (as in GF9)
* Guild changes: GF9-style alliance power i.e. fremen ally can't ship from reserves and nobody can ship back to reserves
* Players announce how many treachery cards they hold at the start of the bidding round and in the case they become full. Other than that, players aren't required to keep the number of treachery cards they hold as public. (tl;dr same as in GF9, in WBC/AH players keep the number of cards public throughout the bidding)
* Allies may not make binding deals, but can still exchange spice during the collection phase

# Misc rulings that are not specified or underspecified in either WBC or GF9:
* Harkonnen kidnapping:
	* hark player looks at the leader before deciding stealing/killing (implied in WBC but not stated explicitly)
	* if the leader is killed, it goes facedown into the tanks as if it was killed after being revived (as in GF9), it flips back up if no leaders eligible for revival are left (that said, if it's the first to the tanks it's still not flipped before all leaders die and all leaders are revived)
* Face-down dead leaders (e.g. Harkonnen kidnap murder victims) can be revived with Ghola or Emperor's Karama
* Can't play a karama to take a card if hand is full (also WBC ruling, but not listed, implied in GF9 too)
* Harkonnen can't play a card **after** winning a bid to free up space for the bonus card
* If a bid winner's ally and the Emperor refuse to subsidise the bid and the bid winner can't pay it (including by playing a karama), the bidding is restarted with the winner forced to sit out
* After a prescience question about "what are you dialing", if then a karama is played to deny fedaykin, sardaukar or to force fremen to spice dial, the answer must be followed through if possible, if not a maximum possible number must be played and a new answer to Atreides need not be provided
* After Guild or their ally announces shipping, if a karama is played to force paying in full, all of the declared shipment must be paid for, but not compulsively for the guild's ally, if not possible then the maximum amount of troops up to the declared number must be shipped
* Hajr must be played on your own ship&move, but can be played before shipment i.e. hajr first, then ship, then do normal movement
* In case of a lasgun explosion, the leaders that aren't part of the battle that previously fought in the same territory aren't killed
* While not required to create conditions that will fulfill a TT answer, the TT victim is not allowed to make any action that would definitely prevent the answer from coming true. Example: Emperor asks BG "will you play a lasgun in Arrakeen this turn if I ship/move into Arrakeen" - they answer "yes", then the Emperor ships some troops to Arrakeen. BG are **not allowed to** declare coexistance (aka flip) because that would prevent them from fulfilling their answer.
* You can't play karama when someone's about to win the bid to take the card. You must be the winner of the bid to be eligible to play karama in that fashion. If it's your turn to bid you can, of course, play karama to get the card though as you're effectively bidding infinity. (this is the case in WBC and implied by GF9 FAQ but the ruling is left intentionally vague)
	* If BG bids infinity and plays wlc and someone else plays a karama to cancel that - the BG are considered to have made an invalid bid and the bidding is restarted without them.
* The Ghola card revivals can include at most 1 star token (fedaykin/sardaukar) regardless whether you already have or will revive a star this turn.
* You may revive a leader at the end of your ship&move if you don't have any leaders available (not counting CH)
* Only Atreides is allowed to keep written records and they may write about anything, other players are not allowed to keep any written records
* No player may use any electronic devices for any reason unless everybody at the table agrees
* Harkonnen's ally must allow the traitor to be revealed in their battle even if Harkonnen wants to
* Allies may enter the same territory if they are separated by storm and thus won't battle
	
# Completely new stuff:
* If Harkonnen draws 2 or more traitors of their own, they may show their traitor hand and request a traitor redeal.
* Making illegal bids is allowed, but if you can't pay and nobody is willing to subsidise - you must keep your spice public until the end of the turn and you are not allowed to make illegal bids for the rest of the bidding.

# Some enforcable terminology:

## Thrown fight
### The thrower
* Lowest leader or Cheap Hero
	* The thrower selects their leader first
	* Cheap Hero only if they wish, the winner may not demand it, even if they can't technically win the fight e.g. because the lowest leader is 5 and the winner can't match it
* Dials whatever the winner asks, up to full unspiced force and may not spend spice on fighting
* Play defences
* Play WLCs

### The winner
* Any leader
* Dial anything
* Play defences
* Play WLCs

### Both
* Call no traitors
* Use no faction powers except Kwisatz, Sardaukar or Fedaykin

### Notes
* Players can always renegotiate the deal with amendments e.g. the thrower can ask to play a higher leader, 

----

## Safe leader
* An alive leader that was among the initial selection of 4 potential traitors and **was not picked**

----

# Time limits:
* Hard 10 second time limit during bidding
	* If you make a deal with Atr or whoever, look at the card first, bid within your allotted time, pay Atr after the bidding is over
* 2 minutes before bidding phase to make deals with Atr or Emp, if both Atr & Emp agree this is foregone
* 30 seconds prior to each opening bid to make deals with Atr or Emp, if both Atr & Emp agree this is foregone
* 2 minutes per nexus
* 30 seconds for BG to decide where and how to flip
* 30 seconds for SG to decide if they want to interject
* 2 minutes per ship&move - if exceeded then the active player is assumed to have passed
* 2 minutes per battle  - if exceeded then the active player is assumed to have played lowest leader and dialed 0
* 30 seconds per BG voice
* 30 seconds per Atreides prescience and 30 seconds per prescience Answer
* Before movement phase, 1 minute is allocated to discuss for free
* Before battle phase, 1 minute are allocated to discuss for free

# Time Chips:
* Players will start with 2 Time Chips and get 1 extra each collection phase, up to a maximum of 4
* Time Chips can be used to parlay with someone for 1 minute (anybody can pay 1 chip, including a non-participant) or to extend anything but ongoing bidding by an extra 1 minute
* Players can spend a chip to parlay at any point outside of an ongoing bidding i.e. including during pre-bidding 30 seconds, the timer of whatever phase is put on pause and continued once the chip time is spent
	* Basically you don't have to wait until the last second to use a chip
* Time chips can not be exchanged or traded themselves, but deals regarding their usage might be made e.g. I'll pay you 2 spice if you spend a chip to parlay with me
* Players can keep spending time chips to prolong a phase or a parlay
* Whoever spent the time chip gets speaking priority
* Players other than the ones that are being paid for to parlay may also speak privately but must return as soon as the parlaying players are done, regardless of how much time is left
	* If you want to parlay uninterrupted - use a chip
* During a battle, whoever isn't ready must spend a time chip to extend the timer, in the case that neither player is ready - both must commit a time chip and whoever is ready first may reclaim their spent chip while the other player has to throw theirs out
	* Basically, whoever's causing the delay has to chip
